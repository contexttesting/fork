      Options for the run method.
    </arg>
    This method will fork a process, and pass the inputs when `stdin` expects an input. Because `includeAnswers` is set to `true` by default, the answers will be included in the resulting `stdout` and `stderr` properties.
    Returns the result of the work, updated to contain answers in the interactive mode.
